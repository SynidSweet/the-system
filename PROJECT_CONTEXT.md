## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Getting Started
- **Setup steps**: 
  1. Clone repository
  2. Install Python 3.11+
  3. Run `./setup.sh` (automated) or create virtual environment manually
  4. Set API keys in `agent_system/.env`
  5. Activate virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`
  6. Start API server (choose one):
     - `python start_api_simple.py` - **RECOMMENDED** (simplified startup, port 8002)
     - `python start_api_minimal.py` - Basic functionality only (port 8001)
     - `python start_api.py` - Full system (complex initialization, may have issues)
- **Required tools**: Python 3.11+, Node.js 18+ (for web UI)
- **Common commands**:
  - `./setup.sh` - Automated dependency setup
  - `source venv/bin/activate` - Activate virtual environment
  - `python start_api_simple.py` - **RECOMMENDED** Start simplified API server
  - `python start_api.py` - Start full API server (complex initialization)
  - `python scripts/seed_system.py` - Initialize with all agents
  - `python scripts/bootstrap_knowledge.py` - Convert docs to knowledge
  - `./svc start/stop/status` - Service management

### Development Practices
- **Branch strategy**: Feature branches → main branch
- **Code review process**: Process-first validation, isolated success verification
- **Testing approach**: Integration tests for process frameworks
- **Debugging approaches**: Manual step mode, comprehensive event logs

## ⚠️ Important Constraints & Gotchas

### Technical Constraints
- **Performance requirements**: Max 3 concurrent agents by default (configurable)
- **Security requirements**: Database-driven permissions, audit trails
- **AI Model limits**: Rate limiting and token constraints per provider

### Development Gotchas
- **Process-first requirement**: Never execute tasks without framework establishment
- **Entity relationships**: All behavior must map to the 6 entity types
- **Tool permissions**: Agents must request tools through proper channels
- **Knowledge gaps**: System will halt if context is insufficient
- **Startup dependencies**: Full system initialization is complex - use simplified startup for development
- **Virtual environment**: Always activate with `source venv/bin/activate` before running

### Troubleshooting
- **"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'"**: Activate virtual environment with `source venv/bin/activate`
- **"No module named 'agent_system'"**: Use the provided startup scripts from project root, not from subdirectories
- **API startup failures**: Use `python start_api_simple.py` instead of `start_api.py` for development
- **Complex initialization errors**: The full system has complex dependencies - simplified startup bypasses these
