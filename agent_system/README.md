# Self-Improving Agent System - Entity-Based Architecture

A **recursive agent system** with entity-based architecture that continuously evolves through automated self-improvement.

## üéØ Core Philosophy: Entity-Driven, Event-Sourced, Self-Improving

This system has been fully migrated to an advanced entity-based architecture:

1. **Entity Framework** - Unified polymorphic entity system
2. **Event-Driven Architecture** - Comprehensive tracking and analysis
3. **Process Framework** - Hybrid Python/LLM execution engine
4. **Runtime Engine** - State machine with automatic progression
5. **MCP Tool System** - Dynamic permission-based capabilities
6. **13 Specialized Agents** - Original 8 + 5 new Phase 6 agents
7. **Self-Improvement Engine** - Automated optimization with safety
8. **Web Interface + API** - Real-time monitoring and control

**Migration Complete: The system now features unlimited self-improvement capabilities.**
