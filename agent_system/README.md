# Self-Improving Agent System - Process-First Architecture

A **process-first recursive agent system** where systematic framework establishment precedes all task execution, transforming undefined problems into systematic domains.

## üéØ Core Philosophy: Process-First, Entity-Based, Self-Improving

This system implements comprehensive process-first architecture:

1. **Process-First Framework** - Systematic structure before execution
2. **Entity-Based Design** - 6 fundamental types with processes primary
3. **Event-Driven Learning** - Process optimization through analysis
4. **Systematic Runtime** - Framework-aware state progression
5. **Process-Bounded Tools** - Capabilities within framework limits
6. **9 Specialized Agents** - Including primary process_discovery agent
7. **Framework Evolution** - Systematic self-improvement
8. **Web Interface + API** - Process visualization and control

**Process-First Architecture: Every task establishes frameworks for isolated success.**

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Complete System Flow
1. User submits task ‚Üí agent_selector
