# Self-Improving Agent System - Complete Foundation

A **recursive agent system** with a complete foundation that builds upon itself through self-improvement.

## üéØ Core Philosophy: Build Complete Foundation, Enable Unlimited Growth

This system implements the complete **foundation** as specified in the launch plan:

1. Universal Agent Runtime (executes any task configuration)
2. Core MCP Toolkit (6 tools for recursion)
3. Complete Agent Suite (8 specialized agents)
4. Full Context Documentation (system docs + process guides)
5. Comprehensive Toolset (internal + external integrations)
6. Database-Driven Architecture (agents, tasks, messages, context, tools)
7. Web Interface + API

**The foundation is complete - agents now build advanced capabilities on top.**

## üîÑ Self-Modification System

The system includes comprehensive self-improvement capabilities with proper safety measures:

### Available Scripts
- **`scripts/self_modify.py`** - Complete self-modification workflow with branch management
- **`scripts/test_system.py`** - Comprehensive system testing (health, functional, performance)
- **`scripts/backup_system.py`** - Full system backup and restore capabilities
- **`scripts/monitor_health.py`** - Real-time health monitoring and alerting

### Self-Modification Workflow
```bash
# Complete self-improvement with safety checks
python scripts/self_modify.py --task-description "Implement new feature X"

# Run comprehensive tests after changes
python scripts/test_system.py

# Create system backup before major changes
python scripts/backup_system.py backup --description "Before major update"

# Monitor system health during changes
python scripts/monitor_health.py --duration 300
```

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Complete System Flow
1. User submits task ‚Üí agent_selector
2. Agent_selector analyzes task and selects appropriate specialist agent
3. If complex ‚Üí routes to task_breakdown for decomposition
4. Specialized agents (context_addition, tool_addition, etc.) handle specific needs
5. Task_evaluator validates results, documentation_agent captures knowledge
6. Summary_agent synthesizes results for parent tasks
7. Supervisor monitors system health, review_agent implements improvements
8. All interactions logged and learned from

### Self-Improvement Loop
1. Agent identifies missing capability
2. Uses `request_tools()` to get it built
3. System becomes more capable
4. Process repeats recursively

### Safety Limits
