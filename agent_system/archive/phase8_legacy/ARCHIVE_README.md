# Phase 8 Legacy Component Archive

This directory contains components that were archived during Phase 8: Legacy Cleanup of the entity-based architecture migration.

## Archive Date
2025-06-20

## Archived Components

### 1. Old Database Models
- `models.py` - Pre-entity framework Pydantic models
- `database_manager.py` - Repository pattern implementation

These were replaced by the entity framework introduced in Phase 3.

### 2. Phase-Specific Scripts
Scripts created for specific migration phases that are no longer needed:
- `test_phase6_agents.py` - Phase 6 agent validation
- `init_phase6_agents.py` - Phase 6 agent initialization
- Other one-time migration scripts

### 3. Legacy Message System
- Components related to the old message-based logging
- Replaced by the event system in Phase 2

### 4. Old Agent Implementations
- Pre-entity framework agent code
- Replaced by entity-based agents

## Why These Were Archived

The system has successfully migrated to:
1. Entity-based architecture (Phase 3)
2. Event-driven logging (Phase 2)
3. Process framework (Phase 4)
4. Runtime engine (Phase 4)
5. MCP-based tooling (Phase 5)

These legacy components are no longer needed but are preserved here for:
- Historical reference
- Emergency rollback (if needed)
- Understanding the system evolution
