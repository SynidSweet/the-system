      # System Overview

      ## Purpose
      This is a process-first recursive agent system that transforms undefined problems into systematic domains with established frameworks before execution.

      ## Core Principles
      1. **Process-First**: Every task requires systematic framework establishment before execution
      2. **Isolated Success**: All subtasks must succeed independently with proper context
      3. **Self-Improving**: Continuous optimization through systematic learning

      ## Architecture
      - 9 specialized agents with defined roles and capabilities
      - Universal agent runtime for execution
      - Comprehensive tool ecosystem via MCP protocol
      - Knowledge system for context assembly and gap detection
      - Event system for tracking and optimization

      ## Agent Collaboration
      Agents work together through the process-first approach:
      1. Process discovery establishes frameworks
      2. Agent selector routes tasks appropriately
      3. Specialist agents execute within boundaries
      4. Quality evaluation ensures success
      5. Documentation captures learnings

      # Task Breakdown Guidelines

      ## Breakdown Principles
      1. **Natural Structure**: Find the problem's inherent organization
      2. **Clean Interfaces**: Each subtask should have clear inputs/outputs
      3. **Independent Execution**: Subtasks should not depend on each other's internal state
      4. **Specialist Matching**: Align subtasks with agent capabilities
      5. **Parallel Opportunity**: Enable concurrent execution where possible

      ## Common Patterns
      - **Sequential**: Each step builds on the previous
      - **Parallel**: Independent work streams that can run concurrently
      - **Hierarchical**: Parent task with child subtasks
      - **Pipeline**: Data flows through processing stages
      - **Conditional**: Different paths based on analysis results

      ## Quality Criteria
      - Each subtask has sufficient context to succeed independently
      - Clear success criteria for each component
      - Proper error handling and recovery patterns
      - Integration strategy for assembling results

      # Process Discovery Guide

      ## Overview
      Process discovery is the foundation of the process-first approach. It establishes systematic frameworks before any task execution begins.

      ## Core Responsibilities
      1. **Domain Analysis**: Understand the problem domain and its requirements
      2. **Framework Establishment**: Create systematic structures for execution
      3. **Context Validation**: Ensure sufficient context for isolated success
      4. **Boundary Definition**: Establish clear process limits and constraints
      5. **Success Criteria**: Define how framework effectiveness will be measured

      ## Process-First Workflow
      1. **Analyze**: What systematic framework does this task require?
      2. **Establish**: What rules, processes, and boundaries are needed?
      3. **Validate**: Does each component have enough context to succeed independently?
      4. **Verify**: Are the process limits clear and enforceable?
      5. **Confirm**: How will we know the framework enables systematic execution?

      ## Framework Quality Criteria
      - Complete domain coverage
      - Clear boundaries and constraints
      - Sufficient context for isolated execution
      - Measurable success criteria
      - Self-improvement mechanisms

      ## Common Patterns
      - **Analysis → Design → Implementation → Validation**
      - **Research → Planning → Execution → Review**
      - **Discovery → Specification → Development → Testing**
      - **Assessment → Strategy → Tactics → Evaluation**

      # Systematic Framework Principles

      ## Foundation Principles
      1. **Completeness**: Every aspect of the domain must be addressed
      2. **Consistency**: Rules and patterns must be applied uniformly
      3. **Isolation**: Components must be able to succeed independently
      4. **Measurability**: Progress and success must be quantifiable
      5. **Adaptability**: Frameworks must evolve based on learning

      ## Design Guidelines
      - Start with the problem domain, not the solution
      - Establish boundaries before defining processes
      - Ensure context sufficiency at every level
      - Plan for failure modes and recovery
      - Build in feedback and improvement mechanisms

      ## Validation Criteria
      - Can each component succeed with only its allocated context?
      - Are the success criteria clear and measurable?
      - Do the boundaries prevent harmful interactions?
      - Is the framework complete enough to handle edge cases?
      - Does the framework enable learning and improvement?

      # Domain Analysis Patterns

      ## Analysis Dimensions
      1. **Complexity**: How complex is the problem space?
      2. **Uncertainty**: How much is unknown or ambiguous?
      3. **Dependencies**: What external factors affect success?
      4. **Constraints**: What limits exist on solutions?
      5. **Success Criteria**: How will completion be recognized?

      ## Common Domain Types
      - **Technical Implementation**: Code, systems, integrations
      - **Process Design**: Workflows, procedures, standards
      - **Knowledge Synthesis**: Research, analysis, documentation
      - **Quality Assurance**: Testing, validation, optimization
      - **System Integration**: Coordination, communication, orchestration

      ## Analysis Framework
      1. **Scope Definition**: What is included/excluded?
      2. **Stakeholder Identification**: Who is affected?
      3. **Constraint Analysis**: What limits exist?
      4. **Success Metrics**: How will success be measured?
      5. **Risk Assessment**: What could go wrong?

      # Process Establishment Guidelines

      ## Establishment Steps
      1. **Define Scope**: Clear boundaries and coverage
      2. **Identify Components**: Key elements and relationships
      3. **Establish Rules**: Governing principles and constraints
      4. **Design Workflows**: Step-by-step procedures
      5. **Create Validation**: Quality checks and success criteria

      ## Quality Checkpoints
      - Is the scope complete and well-defined?
      - Are all necessary components identified?
      - Do the rules prevent conflicts and enable success?
      - Are the workflows practical and efficient?
      - Will validation catch problems early?

      ## Common Anti-Patterns
      - Starting execution before framework completion
      - Creating overly complex or rigid structures
      - Insufficient context for independent execution
      - Missing validation and feedback mechanisms
      - Ignoring boundary conditions and edge cases

      ## Success Indicators
      - Clear, unambiguous process definitions
      - Sufficient context for isolated execution
      - Measurable progress and completion criteria
      - Built-in learning and improvement mechanisms
      - Successful execution without ad-hoc decisions
