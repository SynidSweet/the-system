## Feedback Categorization

### Category Types

1. **Bug Reports**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO feedback_items (category, priority, description, routing)
   VALUES ('bug', 'high', ?, 'recovery_agent');
   ```
   - System errors
   - Unexpected behavior
   - Data issues
   - Performance problems

2. **Feature Requests**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO feedback_items (category, priority, description, routing)
   VALUES ('feature', 'medium', ?, 'planning_agent');
   ```
   - New capabilities
   - Enhancements
   - Workflow improvements
   - Integration requests

3. **Performance Issues**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO feedback_items (category, priority, description, routing)
   VALUES ('performance', 'high', ?, 'optimizer_agent');
   ```
   - Slow operations
   - Timeouts
   - Resource issues
   - Bottlenecks

4. **Questions/Support**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO feedback_items (category, priority, description, routing)
   VALUES ('support', 'medium', ?, 'documentation_agent');
   ```
   - How-to questions
   - Documentation needs
   - Training requests
   - Best practices

### Priority Assessment

Factors to consider:
- User impact (how many affected?)
- Severity (blocking vs inconvenient)
- Frequency (one-time vs recurring)
- Business value (critical vs nice-to-have)

## Feedback Workflows

### Workflow 1: Bug Report Processing

1. **Collection**
   ```python
   feedback = {
       "type": "bug",
       "description": user_input,
       "timestamp": datetime.now(),
       "user_context": get_user_context(),
       "system_state": capture_system_state()
   }
   ```

2. **Validation**
   - Is it reproducible?
   - Do we have enough info?
   - Is it already known?

3. **Routing**
   - Critical bugs → Recovery Agent
   - Investigation needed → Investigator Agent
   - Known issues → Link to existing

4. **Follow-up**
   - Acknowledge receipt
   - Provide timeline
   - Update on progress
   - Confirm resolution

### Workflow 2: Feature Request Handling

1. **Capture Details**
   - What problem does it solve?
   - Who benefits?
   - What's the use case?
   - Any constraints?

2. **Evaluation**
   ```sql
   -- Check for similar requests
   SELECT * FROM feedback_items
   WHERE category = 'feature'
     AND description LIKE '%' || ? || '%'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```

3. **Planning Integration**
   - Send to Planning Agent
   - Get feasibility assessment
   - Estimate effort
   - Prioritize

4. **User Communication**
   - Thank for suggestion
   - Explain evaluation process
   - Provide decision/timeline
   - Update on implementation

## Integration Points

- Ask clarifying questions
- Confirm understanding
- Show you care

### 2. Timely Response
- Acknowledge within 1 hour
- Initial response within 4 hours
- Regular updates every 24-48 hours
- Resolution notification immediately

### 3. Clear Communication

## Metrics and Tracking

### Response Metrics
```sql
-- Average response time
SELECT 
    category,
    AVG(JULIANDAY(first_response) - JULIANDAY(created_at)) * 24 as avg_hours_to_response,
    AVG(JULIANDAY(resolved_at) - JULIANDAY(created_at)) * 24 as avg_hours_to_resolution,
    COUNT(*) as total_items
FROM feedback_items
WHERE created_at > datetime('now', '-30 days')
GROUP BY category;
```

### Satisfaction Metrics
```sql
-- User satisfaction tracking
SELECT 
    resolution_rating,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    AVG(resolution_time_hours) as avg_resolution_time
FROM feedback_items
WHERE resolved_at IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY resolution_rating
ORDER BY resolution_rating DESC;
```

### Category Distribution
```sql
-- Feedback categories
SELECT 
    category,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'resolved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as resolved,
    ROUND(CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'resolved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS FLOAT) / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) as resolution_rate
FROM feedback_items
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Frustrated User
```

I'll prioritize getting this fixed for you."
```

### Scenario 2: Feature Request
```
