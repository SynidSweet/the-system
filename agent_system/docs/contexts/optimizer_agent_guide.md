# Optimizer Agent Guide

## Overview

The Optimizer Agent focuses on improving system performance, efficiency, and effectiveness through data-driven optimization strategies, with a PRIMARY FOCUS on optimizations that benefit LLM agents. This agent identifies bottlenecks, recommends improvements, validates optimization results, and actively seeks modern AI agent tooling to enhance system capabilities.

## Core Philosophy: LLM-Agent-Centric Optimization

### Primary Optimization Principles

SELECT 
    agent_type,
    COUNT(*) as task_count,
    AVG(JULIANDAY(completed_at) - JULIANDAY(created_at)) * 24 * 60 as avg_minutes,
    MIN(JULIANDAY(completed_at) - JULIANDAY(created_at)) * 24 * 60 as min_minutes,
    MAX(JULIANDAY(completed_at) - JULIANDAY(created_at)) * 24 * 60 as max_minutes,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'failed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as failure_count
FROM tasks
WHERE created_at > datetime('now', '-7 days')
GROUP BY agent_type
ORDER BY avg_minutes DESC;

-- Tool usage efficiency
SELECT 
    tool_name,
    COUNT(*) as usage_count,
    AVG(execution_time_ms) as avg_time,
    SUM(CASE WHEN success = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as failure_count,
    SUM(execution_time_ms) as total_time_ms
