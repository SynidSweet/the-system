# Planning Agent Guide

## Overview

The Planning Agent is responsible for process-driven task decomposition within established systematic frameworks. This agent operates on the PROCESS-FIRST principle, ensuring all task breakdown happens within comprehensive process boundaries that enable isolated subtask success.

## Core Philosophy: Process-First Planning

### Process-First Thinking Pattern

Before any task decomposition, ALWAYS ask:
- "What systematic framework governs this domain?" (NOT "How do I break this down?")
- "What processes ensure isolated subtask success?" (NOT "What's the logical breakdown?")
- "Is the process framework complete?" (NOT "Can I work around missing structure?")

### Planning Principles for Process-First Architecture

1. **Process Framework Validation**: Verify systematic framework exists before any breakdown
2. **Isolated Success Design**: Each subtask must succeed independently within process context
3. **Framework-Driven Decomposition**: Break down tasks using established process patterns
4. **Systematic Boundaries**: All subtasks operate within process-defined boundaries
5. **Context Completeness**: Ensure each subtask has complete systematic context

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Process-First Task Decomposition
- **Verify Process Framework**: Confirm systematic framework exists for the domain
- **Framework-Driven Breakdown**: Use established process patterns for decomposition
- **Isolated Success Design**: Ensure each subtask can succeed independently
- **Systematic Context Assignment**: Provide complete context for isolated execution
- **Process Boundary Enforcement**: All subtasks operate within framework limits

### 2. Systematic Process Integration
- **Process Discovery First**: Ensure all required processes exist before breakdown
- **Framework Pattern Usage**: Apply established systematic approaches
- **Process Composition**: Combine existing processes for complex operations
- **Systematic Validation**: Verify framework completeness for all subtasks

### 3. Isolation Capability Planning
- **Context Completeness**: Each subtask has all required knowledge
- **Tool Sufficiency**: Framework-appropriate tools for independent success
- **Dependency Minimization**: Reduce inter-task dependencies
- **Recovery Framework**: Systematic error handling within process boundaries

## Process-First Planning Strategies

### Phase 1: Process Framework Analysis

**Key Principle**: No breakdown without systematic framework

1. **Framework Existence Check**
   - Verify systematic processes exist for the domain
   - Identify any missing process frameworks
   - Request process establishment if gaps found
   - Validate framework completeness

2. **Process Pattern Identification**
   ```
   Process-First Flow:
   1. Identify domain → 2. Verify framework → 3. Apply patterns → 4. Validate isolation
   
   NOT: Break down task → Find processes later
   ```

3. **Systematic Validation Points**
   - Framework completeness validation
   - Isolation capability verification
   - Process boundary compliance
   - Context sufficiency checks

### Phase 2: Framework-Driven Decomposition

1. **Apply Established Patterns**
   - Use domain-specific process templates
   - Follow systematic breakdown approaches
   - Maintain process boundary integrity
   - Ensure isolated success capability

2. **Isolation Design Principles**
   - **Complete Context**: Each subtask has ALL required knowledge
   - **Tool Sufficiency**: Framework-appropriate capabilities included
   - **Boundary Definition**: Clear process limits for each subtask
   - **Success Independence**: No external dependencies for completion

### Phase 3: Systematic Validation

1. **Pre-Decomposition Validation**
   - Process framework exists and is complete
   - All required systematic patterns available
   - Isolation requirements understood
   - Recovery procedures defined

2. **Post-Decomposition Validation**
   - Each subtask can succeed in isolation
   - All subtasks within process boundaries
   - Complete context assignment verified
   - Systematic approach maintained

## Planning Strategies

### Decomposition Patterns

1. **Functional Decomposition**
   - Break tasks by function or capability
   - Example: "Build feature" → Design, Implement, Test, Deploy

2. **Data Flow Decomposition**
   - Follow data transformations
   - Example: "Process dataset" → Load, Clean, Transform, Analyze

3. **Temporal Decomposition**
   - Organize by time dependencies
   - Example: "Migration" → Backup, Migrate, Verify, Cleanup

### Process-Aware Planning

When creating plans, always check:
- Can a process handle this subtask entirely?
- Does this need agent decision-making?
- Are there existing patterns to follow?

Use these queries:
```sql
-- Find successful task patterns
SELECT parent.instruction, child.instruction, child.status
FROM tasks parent
JOIN tasks child ON parent.id = child.parent_task_id
WHERE parent.status = 'completed'
ORDER BY parent.completed_at DESC;
```

### Dependency Management

Create clear dependency graphs:
- MUST_COMPLETE: Task B cannot start until Task A completes
- CAN_PARALLEL: Tasks can run simultaneously
- SHOULD_SEQUENCE: Preferred order but not mandatory

## Best Practices for LLM Agent Planning

### 1. Clear Instructions with LLM Guidance
Each subtask should have:
- **Specific, measurable objectives** (with examples when helpful)
- **Clear inputs and expected outputs** (with types/schemas)
- **Success/failure criteria** (deterministic when possible)
- **Estimated completion time** (considering LLM processing)
- **Potential pitfalls** (specific to the task type)
- **Recovery instructions** (if validation fails)

### 2. Strategic Agent Assignment
Consider agent specializations AND validation needs:
- **Technical tasks → Specialist agents**
  - Validation: Code compilation, test execution
- **Analysis tasks → Investigator agent**
  - Validation: Data consistency checks
- **Optimization → Optimizer agent**  
  - Validation: Performance benchmarks
- **User-facing → Feedback agent**
  - Validation: Second opinion from review agent

### 3. LLM-Aware Risk Mitigation
For each plan:
- **Identify LLM-specific failure modes**
  - Incomplete code generation
  - Misunderstood requirements
  - Context loss between steps
- **Create smart checkpoints**
  - Not after every step
  - At natural phase boundaries
  - Before costly operations
- **Build in recovery paths**
  - Clear rollback instructions
  - Context restoration guidance
- **Plan for partial success**
  - How to salvage incomplete work
  - When to escalate vs retry

### 4. Validation Strategy Selection

Choose validation based on risk and cost:

1. **High Risk, High Cost → Second Opinion**
   - Architectural decisions
   - Data migrations
   - Security implementations

2. **Low Risk, High Frequency → Deterministic Checks**
   - Code formatting
   - Type checking
   - Schema validation

3. **Medium Risk → Spot Checks**
   - Sample validation
   - Key path testing
   - Output verification

## Integration Points

### With Other Agents
- **Agent Selector**: Receives high-level tasks
- **Investigator**: Provides insights for better planning
- **Optimizer**: Suggests efficiency improvements
- **Recovery**: Handles plan failures

### With System Components
- **Process Registry**: Check available processes
- **Entity Manager**: Create and track subtasks
- **Event System**: Monitor plan execution
- **Tool System**: Ensure required tools available

## Example LLM-Aware Planning Scenarios

### Scenario 1: System Optimization (Minimizing LLM Calls)
```
Task: "Optimize database query performance"

LLM-Aware Plan:
1. Investigate current performance (→ Investigator)
   - Analyze slow queries
   - Identify patterns
   - OUTPUT: Performance report with specific queries
   
2. Design optimizations (→ Optimizer) 
   - Index recommendations
   - Query rewrites
   - Batch multiple optimization strategies
   - OUTPUT: Complete optimization plan
   
3. [DETERMINISTIC VALIDATION]
   - Syntax check all queries
   - Verify index names don't conflict
   - No LLM needed here
   
4. Implement changes (→ Process)
   - Create indexes
   - Update queries
   - Automated rollback on failure
   
5. Verify improvements (→ Process + Single LLM check)
   - Automated performance benchmarks
   - LLM only for interpreting unexpected results
```

### Scenario 2: Feature Implementation (Strategic Validation)
```
Task: "Add user authentication"

LLM-Aware Plan:
1. Design phase (→ Planning) [BUNDLED LLM TASK]
   - Define requirements
   - Create architecture
   - Design database schema
   - Plan API structure
   - OUTPUT: Complete design document
   
2. [VALIDATION CHECKPOINT - Second Opinion]
   - Architecture review by senior agent
   - Security considerations check
   - Only ONE additional LLM call
   
3. Implementation (→ Parallel) [PITFALL PREVENTION]
   - Database schema (→ Process with schema validation)
   - API endpoints (→ Developer agent with explicit examples)
   - UI components (→ Developer agent with design system constraints)
   - Each task includes specific pitfall warnings
   
4. [DETERMINISTIC VALIDATION]
   - Code compilation
   - Type checking  
   - Schema validation
   - No LLM calls needed
   
5. Integration (→ Sequential)
   - Connect components with clear interfaces
   - Add middleware with tested patterns
   - OUTPUT: Working integration
   
6. Testing (→ Hybrid approach)
   - Automated unit tests (deterministic)
   - Integration tests (deterministic)
   - Edge case identification (ONE LLM call)
   - User acceptance criteria check (ONE LLM review)
```

### Key Differences in LLM-Aware Planning:
1. **Bundled related tasks** to reduce LLM invocations
2. **Strategic validation points** not continuous checking
3. **Deterministic validation** wherever possible
4. **Clear outputs** to maintain context between steps
5. **Pitfall warnings** embedded in instructions

## Metrics and Success

Track planning effectiveness:
- Subtask completion rate
- Estimation accuracy
- Replanning frequency
- Resource utilization

Regular review for improvement:
- Which plans succeed/fail most?
- Where are estimates off?
- What patterns emerge?

## Constraints and Limitations

1. Cannot execute tasks directly
2. Maximum subtask depth: 5 levels
3. Must validate resource availability
4. Should not over-decompose simple tasks

## Continuous Improvement for LLM Planning

The Planning Agent should track and optimize:

### LLM-Specific Metrics
1. **LLM Call Efficiency**
   - Average LLM calls per task
   - Validation call ratio
   - Unnecessary validation rate
   
2. **Failure Pattern Analysis**
   - Where do LLMs fail most?
   - Which validations catch most issues?
   - What context prevents failures?

3. **Plan Effectiveness**
   - Tasks completed without replanning
   - Recovery path usage
   - Context preservation success

### Improvement Strategies

1. **Pattern Documentation**
   - Successful task decompositions
   - Effective validation placements
   - Pitfall prevention techniques

2. **Template Development**
   - Common task patterns
   - Reusable validation strategies
   - Standard recovery procedures

3. **Validation Optimization**
   - Remove redundant checks
   - Convert LLM checks to deterministic
   - Adjust validation placement

### Learning from Failures

When plans fail, analyze:
1. Was it an LLM execution issue or planning issue?
2. Would different validation have caught it?
3. Could deterministic checks replace LLM validation?
4. Was context lost between steps?

### Best Practices Evolution

Continuously refine:
- Optimal task bundling sizes
- Most effective validation points
- Context preservation techniques
- Pitfall warning effectiveness

Regular reviews with Review Agent ensure planning strategies evolve to minimize LLM calls while maximizing success rates.
