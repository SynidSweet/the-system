# Process-First Entity Architecture Guide

## Core Concept

The agent system is built around six fundamental entity types that work together to create a systematic process-first, recursive problem-solving architecture. Every component of the system—from agents to tasks to documentation—is an entity that enables systematic process establishment and exists within comprehensive process frameworks for isolated task success.

## The Six Entity Types in Process-First Context

### 1. Processes - The Systematic Frameworks (Primary Entity)
**Purpose**: Comprehensive systematic frameworks that define complete domain approaches before any task execution

**Key Characteristics**:
- Processes are the primary organizing principle - all other entities exist to support process establishment and execution
- Every task domain requires comprehensive process framework analysis before execution begins
- Process templates encode complete systematic approaches including rules, regulations, and contextual requirements
- Process discovery and establishment happens before all task breakdown and agent assignment

**Entity Relationships**:
- **Establishes framework for** all other entity types and their interactions
- **Defines systematic boundaries for** Agent capabilities and responsibilities
- **Provides structure for** Task decomposition and isolated execution
- **Specifies requirements for** Tool usage and capability combinations
- **Determines context needs for** Document utilization and knowledge application
- **Generates** Events through systematic execution and framework utilization

**Process-First Lifecycle**:
1. **Discovery**: Process Discovery Agent analyzes task domains for required systematic structure
2. **Establishment**: Missing process frameworks created before any task execution begins
3. **Validation**: Process frameworks validated for completeness and isolated task success capability
4. **Systematic Execution**: All tasks execute within established process boundaries
5. **Evolution**: Process frameworks improve through systematic usage analysis and optimization

### 2. Agents - The Process Framework Executors
**Purpose**: Specialized LLM instances that work within established process frameworks to execute systematic domain approaches

**Key Characteristics**:
- Agents operate within systematic process boundaries rather than ad-hoc problem solving
