# MVP Knowledge System Specification

## Core Philosophy

The MVP knowledge system is a **bootstrap-first, growth-oriented** architecture that:
- Starts with converted documentation as initial knowledge entities
- Runs initialization tasks to establish systematic frameworks
- Uses simple JSON-based storage that can migrate to graph databases later
- Focuses on enabling isolated task success through complete context provision
- Grows systematically through usage-driven knowledge creation

## MVP Architecture Components

### 1. Simple Knowledge Storage (File-Based)
```
knowledge/
├── domains/           # Domain knowledge organized by area
├── processes/         # Process framework knowledge
├── agents/           # Agent specialization knowledge  
├── tools/            # Tool usage and capability knowledge
├── patterns/         # Successful execution patterns
└── system/           # Meta-knowledge about system operation
```

### 2. Knowledge Entity Format (JSON-based)
Each knowledge entity is a structured JSON file with metadata and relationships:
```json
{
  "id": "unique_knowledge_id",
  "type": "domain|process|agent|tool|pattern|system",
  "name": "human_readable_name",
  "domain": "primary_domain_area",
  "process_frameworks": ["applicable_process_frameworks"],
  "content": {
    "summary": "brief_overview",
    "core_concepts": ["key_concepts_list"],
    "procedures": ["step_by_step_procedures"],
    "examples": ["concrete_examples"],
    "quality_criteria": ["success_criteria"],
    "common_pitfalls": ["what_to_avoid"]
  },
  "relationships": {
    "enables": ["knowledge_ids_this_enables"],
    "requires": ["prerequisite_knowledge_ids"],
    "related": ["related_knowledge_ids"]
  },
  "context_templates": {
    "task_context": "template_for_task_context",
    "agent_context": "template_for_agent_context"
  },
  "isolation_requirements": {
    "minimum_context": ["required_for_independent_work"],
    "validation_criteria": ["how_to_verify_completeness"]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "created_at": "timestamp",
    "last_updated": "timestamp", 
    "usage_count": 0,
    "effectiveness_score": 0.0,
    "source": "documentation|task_execution|system_learning"
  }
}
```

### 3. Context Assembly Engine (Python Module)
```python
# knowledge/context_engine.py
class MVPContextEngine:
    def get_context_for_task(self, task_instruction: str, agent_type: str) -> ContextPackage
    def validate_context_completeness(self, context_package: ContextPackage) -> ValidationResult
    def identify_knowledge_gaps(self, task_requirements: TaskRequirements) -> List[KnowledgeGap]
    def create_context_template(self, successful_execution: ExecutionResult) -> ContextTemplate
```

### 4. Knowledge Discovery Workflows
Simple processes that create knowledge from successful executions:
```python
# After successful task completion
knowledge_discovery_workflow:
  1. Extract patterns from successful execution
  2. Identify reusable context combinations
  3. Create knowledge entities for new patterns
  4. Update existing knowledge relationships
  5. Generate context templates for similar tasks
```

## MVP Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Documentation Conversion (Day 1)
1. **Convert existing documentation** into initial knowledge entities
2. **Create domain knowledge** for each major area (agents, processes, tools)
3. **Establish baseline relationships** between knowledge entities
4. **Generate initial context templates** from documentation patterns

### Phase 2: System Initialization (Day 1-2)
1. **Run initialization tasks** to establish process frameworks
2. **Create agent specialization knowledge** based on agent guides
3. **Build tool capability knowledge** from tool documentation
4. **Establish system operation knowledge** from architecture docs

### Phase 3: Dynamic Growth (Ongoing)
1. **Learn from task executions** to create new knowledge
2. **Optimize context assembly** based on success patterns
3. **Identify knowledge gaps** through failed task analysis
4. **Evolve knowledge relationships** through usage analysis

## Key MVP Design Decisions

### Simple File-Based Storage
- **JSON files** in organized directory structure
- **Git-versioned** for change tracking and rollback capability
- **Easy migration path** to graph databases when needed
- **Human-readable** for debugging and manual inspection

### Template-Based Context Assembly
- **Context templates** for common task patterns
- **Variable substitution** for task-specific customization
- **Hierarchical inheritance** from domain → process → task
- **Validation scoring** for context completeness

### Bootstrap-First Approach
- **Existing documentation** converted to initial knowledge base
- **Initialization tasks** establish systematic frameworks
- **Self-improving** through execution feedback
- **Growth-oriented** design for future complexity

### Usage-Driven Evolution
- **Track context effectiveness** through task success rates
- **Identify successful patterns** for knowledge creation
- **Optimize context assembly** based on usage data
- **Retire ineffective knowledge** through low usage scoring

## Integration with Entity Framework

### Entity Extensions
```sql
-- Add knowledge tracking to existing entities
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN context_package_id VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN knowledge_gaps_identified TEXT;
ALTER TABLE agents ADD COLUMN knowledge_domain VARCHAR(255);
ALTER TABLE processes ADD COLUMN knowledge_requirements TEXT;
```

### Event Extensions
```python
# New event types for knowledge system
EVENT_TYPES = [
    "knowledge_gap_detected",
    "context_package_assembled", 
    "knowledge_entity_created",
    "context_effectiveness_measured",
    "knowledge_relationship_discovered"
]
```

## MVP Success Criteria

### Week 1: Bootstrap Complete
- [ ] All existing documentation converted to knowledge entities
- [ ] Initial context templates created for each agent type
- [ ] System can assemble context for basic tasks
- [ ] Knowledge gap detection working

### Week 2: Dynamic Learning
- [ ] New knowledge entities created from successful executions
- [ ] Context assembly optimized based on usage patterns
- [ ] Knowledge relationships discovered automatically
- [ ] System demonstrates knowledge accumulation

### Week 4: Self-Sufficiency
- [ ] System creates comprehensive knowledge for new domains
- [ ] Context completeness validation prevents isolated task failures
- [ ] Knowledge evolution improves task success rates
- [ ] Minimal manual knowledge management required

## Migration Path to Full Architecture

The MVP is designed to migrate seamlessly to the full knowledge graph architecture:

1. **JSON entities** → Graph database nodes
2. **File relationships** → Graph database edges  
3. **Template engine** → RAG-enhanced context assembly
4. **Usage tracking** → ML-powered optimization
5. **Manual curation** → Automated knowledge management

This MVP provides immediate value while establishing the foundation for sophisticated knowledge management as the system evolves.
