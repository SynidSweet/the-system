# Process-First Cleanup Status

## Summary

The process-first architecture has been successfully implemented. Most remnants of the old task-first approach have been cleaned up, with only minor references remaining that don't affect functionality.

## Completed Cleanup

### 1. Core System Files ✅
- **CLAUDE.md**: Fully updated with process-first philosophy
- **neutral_task_process.py**: Completely rewritten for process-first flow
- **All agent instructions**: Updated via migration 012
- **New process files**: Created process_discovery_process.py and domain_analysis_process.py

### 2. Documentation Updates ✅
- **project_principles.md**: Updated to process-first philosophy
- **README.md**: Updated agent count and philosophy
- **API main.py**: Updated UI text and examples
- **planning_agent_guide.md**: Transformed to process-driven approach

### 3. Database Migrations ✅
- **011_add_process_discovery_agent.sql**: Adds process_discovery agent
- **012_update_agents_process_first.sql**: Updates all agents with process-first principles
- **013_cleanup_process_first.sql**: Final cleanup and consistency checks

## Minor Remaining Items

### 1. Model Configuration
- **config/model_config.py**: Contains "task_breakdown" as a task type (line 142)
  - This is just a model selection preference, not an agent reference
  - No functional impact

### 2. Historical References
- Some migration files reference the progression from 8 to 9 agents
- These are historical records and don't need changing

### 3. Task Breakdown vs Planning Agent
- Both names appear in the system
- "planning_agent" is the preferred name going forward
- "task_breakdown" remains for backward compatibility in some places

## Recommendations

1. **No Critical Changes Needed**: The system is functionally complete with process-first architecture

2. **Optional Future Cleanup**:
   - Standardize on "planning_agent" name throughout
   - Update model_config.py task types to reflect process-first thinking
   - Archive old migration phases if desired

3. **Testing**:
   - Run migrations 011, 012, and 013
   - Test that new tasks go through process discovery
   - Verify all agents operate with process-first principles

## Architecture State

The system now operates with:
- **9 agents** (including process_discovery as primary)
- **Process-first flow** for all tasks
- **Systematic framework establishment** before execution
- **Isolated task success** through complete context
- **No ad-hoc execution paths**

The codebase is clean and consistent with the new process-first philosophy.
