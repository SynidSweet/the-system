# Process-First Architecture Implementation Guide

## Core Philosophy: Systematic Structure Before Execution

### The Fundamental Principle

The agent system must operate on a **"process-first, never task-first"** philosophy where:

1. **Every task is approached by first establishing the complete structural framework** needed for systematic execution
2. **All subtasks become isolated puzzle pieces** that can succeed independently within well-defined processes
3. **No ad-hoc problem solving** - every domain requires comprehensive process establishment before execution
4. **Multilayered process architecture** where complex tasks are broken down through systematic structural analysis

### The Vision: Isolated Task Success Through Process Framework

The goal is a system where:
- **Any isolated subtask** can be solved by an LLM with the right combination of context and established processes
- **Broad, undefined tasks** are transformed into systematic frameworks with rules, references, and regulations
- **Process establishment happens first**, creating the possibility for isolated task success
- **System intelligence grows through process accumulation** rather than just task completion

## Current Implementation Gaps

### 1. Task-Centric vs Process-Centric Flow

**Current Flow (Task-First):**
```
User Task → Agent Selection → Task Breakdown → Process Usage (if available)
```

**Required Flow (Process-First):**
```
User Task → Process Discovery → Framework Establishment → Systematic Breakdown → Isolated Execution
```

### 2. Reactive Process Usage

Currently, the system:
- Uses existing processes when available
- Falls back to ad-hoc approaches when processes don't exist
- Treats process creation as optional optimization

Should instead:
- Always analyze required process framework first
- Establish missing processes before any task execution
- Treat comprehensive process framework as prerequisite for task success

### 3. Agent Instructions Lack Process-First Thinking

Current agent guides focus on:
- Task completion strategies
- Tool and context optimization
- Quality assurance after execution

Missing:
- Process framework validation as first step
- Systematic structure establishment before execution
- Domain architecture thinking over task solution thinking

## Required Implementation Changes

### 1. New Process Discovery Agent

**Purpose**: Analyze incoming tasks and establish complete process frameworks before any execution begins.

**Core Responsibilities**:
- Analyze task domains for required systematic structure
- Identify missing processes, rules, and frameworks
- Create comprehensive process architecture before task breakdown
- Ensure isolated subtasks can succeed within established structure

**Agent Configuration**:
```python
# Add to agent_base_permissions table
'process_discovery': {
    'entity_permissions': '{"process": ["read", "write"], "document": ["read", "write"], "task": ["read"], "tool": ["read"]}',
    'base_tools': '["entity_manager", "sql_lite", "file_system_listing"]'
}
```

### 2. Revised neutral_task_process (Process-First)

**Current Issue**: Focuses on agent/context/tool assignment rather than process establishment.

**Required Change**: Make process discovery and establishment the mandatory first phase.

```python
# Updated neutral_task_process.py
class NeutralTaskProcess:
    async def execute(self, task_id: int):
        task = await self.sys.get_task(task_id)
        
        # PHASE 1: PROCESS DISCOVERY AND ESTABLISHMENT (ALWAYS FIRST)
        process_discovery_task_id = await self.sys.create_subtask(
            parent_id=task_id,
            instruction=f"Analyze and establish all necessary processes for: {task.instruction}",
            agent_type="process_discovery",
            context=["process_discovery_guide", "process_framework_guide"],
            process="process_discovery_process"
        )
        
        await self.sys.wait_for_tasks([process_discovery_task_id])
        process_result = await self.sys.get_task_result(process_discovery_task_id)
        
        # PHASE 2: STRUCTURE VALIDATION AND CREATION
        if process_result.missing_processes:
            # Create missing processes before proceeding
            for missing_process in process_result.missing_processes:
                creation_task_id = await self.sys.create_subtask(
                    parent_id=task_id,
                    instruction=f"Create process: {missing_process.description}",
                    agent_type="process_discovery",
                    context=["process_creation_guide"],
                    parameters=missing_process.specification
                )
            
            # Wait for all missing processes to be created
            await self.sys.wait_for_tasks(creation_task_ids)
        
        # PHASE 3: STRUCTURED TASK EXECUTION (ONLY AFTER PROCESSES ESTABLISHED)
        if process_result.established_processes:
            await self.sys.update_task(task_id, 
                process=process_result.primary_process,
                additional_context=process_result.process_documentation
            )
        
        await self.sys.update_task_state(task_id, TaskState.READY_FOR_AGENT)
```

### 3. Planning Agent Transformation

**Current Focus**: Task breakdown with optional process usage.

**Required Focus**: Process-driven decomposition with systematic structure establishment.

**Key Changes Needed**:

```python
planning_approach = {
    "phase_1_process_analysis": {
        "existing_process_identification": "identify_all_applicable_existing_processes",
        "process_gap_analysis": "determine_what_processes_are_missing_for_complete_framework",
        "domain_structure_requirements": "analyze_what_systematic_structure_this_domain_needs",
        "process_composition_opportunities": "identify_how_existing_processes_can_be_combined"
    },
    "phase_2_process_establishment": {
        "missing_process_creation": "create_necessary_processes_before_any_task_breakdown",
        "process_documentation": "document_all_rules_structures_and_frameworks_established",
        "validation_framework": "ensure_processes_enable_isolated_task_success",
        "structure_completeness_testing": "validate_that_framework_is_comprehensive"
    },
    "phase_3_structured_breakdown": {
        "process_driven_decomposition": "break_down_task_using_only_established_processes",
        "isolated_subtask_design": "ensure_each_subtask_has_complete_context_for_independent_success",
        "framework_compliance": "ensure_all_subtasks_work_within_established_structure",
        "success_validation": "verify_each_isolated_piece_can_succeed_independently"
    }
}
```

### 4. Agent Selector Process Verification

**Current Focus**: Matching agents to tasks.

**Required Addition**: Process framework verification before agent selection.

```python
async def select_with_process_verification(self, task_classification: TaskClassification) -> ProcessFirstSelection:
    # FIRST: Verify necessary processes exist
    required_processes = await self.identify_required_processes(task_classification)
    missing_processes = await self.check_missing_processes(required_processes)
    
    if missing_processes:
        return ProcessFirstSelection(
            action="establish_processes_first",
            required_process_establishment=missing_processes,
            message="Processes must be established before agent selection"
        )
    
    # ONLY THEN: Select appropriate agent
    return ProcessFirstSelection(
        action="proceed_with_agent_selection",
        selected_agent=await self.select_optimal_agent(task_classification),
        applicable_processes=required_processes
    )
```

### 5. Universal Agent Instruction Updates

**Add to ALL agent guides**: Process-first operational principle.

```markdown
## Core Principle: Process-First Operation

Before attempting any task execution, ALWAYS:

1. **Verify Process Framework**: Check that all necessary processes, rules, and systematic structures exist for this task domain
2. **Request Process Establishment**: If any structural framework is missing, request process creation BEFORE attempting task execution
3. **Work Within Framework**: Execute only within established, documented processes - never use ad-hoc approaches
4. **Validate Isolation**: Ensure your approach enables isolated subtask success through systematic structure

### Process-First Thinking Pattern:
- "What systematic framework does this domain require?" (NOT "How do I solve this task?")
- "What processes need to exist for isolated subtasks to succeed?" (NOT "What's the quickest solution?")
- "Is the structural foundation complete?" (NOT "Can I work around missing structure?")
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Process Discovery Framework

#### 1.1 Create Process Discovery Agent
- **File**: `process_discovery_agent_guide.md`
- **Focus**: Systematic analysis of task domains for required process frameworks
- **Key Capability**: Transform broad, undefined tasks into systematic structural frameworks

#### 1.2 Create process_discovery_process.py
- **Purpose**: Execute comprehensive process framework analysis
- **Output**: Complete process requirements and gap analysis
- **Integration**: Works with existing process creation infrastructure

#### 1.3 Update Database Schema
```sql
-- Add process discovery agent to permissions
INSERT INTO agent_base_permissions (agent_type, entity_permissions, base_tools) VALUES
('process_discovery', '{"process": ["read", "write"], "document": ["read", "write"], "task": ["read"], "tool": ["read"]}', '["entity_manager", "sql_lite", "file_system_listing"]');
```

### Phase 2: Process-First Workflow Integration

#### 2.1 Update neutral_task_process.py
- Replace reactive approach with mandatory process establishment
- Add process gap analysis and creation phases
- Ensure no task execution without complete process framework

#### 2.2 Update planning_agent_guide.md
- Transform from task-breakdown focus to process-driven decomposition
- Add systematic structure establishment as core responsibility
- Emphasize isolated subtask success through process frameworks

#### 2.3 Update agent_selector_guide.md
- Add process verification as prerequisite to agent selection
- Include process establishment workflows
- Prevent task assignment without complete structural framework

### Phase 3: Universal Agent Updates

#### 3.1 Add Process-First Principle to All Agent Guides
**Files to Update**:
- `context_addition_guide.md`
- `tool_addition_guide.md`
- `task_evaluator_guide.md`
- `summary_agent_guide.md`
- `documentation_agent_guide.md`
- `review_agent_guide.md`
- `feedback_agent_guide.md`
- `request_validation_guide.md`
- `investigator_agent_guide.md`
- `optimizer_agent_guide.md`
- `recovery_agent_guide.md`

**Standard Addition**:
```markdown
## Process-First Operation Principle

### Before Any Task Execution:
1. **Verify Process Framework**: Confirm all necessary systematic structures exist
2. **Request Missing Processes**: Use `need_process_establishment()` tool when structural gaps identified
3. **Work Within Framework**: Operate only within established, documented processes
4. **Enable Isolation**: Ensure your approach enables isolated subtask success

### Process-First Thinking:
- Domain architecture over task solutions
- Systematic structure over ad-hoc approaches
- Process establishment over immediate execution
- Framework completeness over quick fixes
```

### Phase 4: Process Creation and Validation Tools

#### 4.1 Add need_process_establishment() Tool
```python
# New tool for requesting process establishment
async def need_process_establishment(self, process_description: str, domain_analysis: str, 
                                   framework_requirements: str) -> int:
    """Request establishment of missing processes before task execution"""
    return await self.sys.create_subtask(
        parent_id=self.current_task_id,
        instruction=f"Establish process framework: {process_description}",
        agent_type="process_discovery",
        parameters={
            "domain_analysis": domain_analysis,
            "framework_requirements": framework_requirements,
            "process_description": process_description
        }
    )
```

#### 4.2 Process Validation Framework
- Automated checking for process completeness
- Isolated subtask success validation
- Framework coverage analysis

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate Benefits
1. **Systematic Structure**: Every task domain gets comprehensive process framework
2. **Isolated Success**: Subtasks can succeed independently with proper context
3. **Reduced Ad-Hoc Solutions**: Elimination of improvised approaches
4. **Process Accumulation**: System intelligence grows through process library expansion

### Long-term Evolution
1. **Domain Expertise**: Comprehensive process coverage for all task domains
2. **Predictable Execution**: All tasks follow systematic, documented approaches
3. **Self-Improving Architecture**: Process frameworks evolve and optimize over time
4. **Scalable Intelligence**: New domains automatically get comprehensive process establishment
