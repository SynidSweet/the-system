# Modular Backup System

A comprehensive backup and restore system for the agent system, decomposed into focused modular components for improved maintainability and testing.

## Architecture

The backup system is organized into 4 main components:

### 1. BackupUtils (`backup_utils.py`)
**Shared utilities and metadata handling** (129 lines)
- Backup ID generation
- Metadata creation and management
- Path standardization
- Validation utilities
- Status formatting

### 2. BackupCreator (`backup_creator.py`)
**Backup creation functionality** (190 lines)
- Database backup
- Configuration backup
- Code state backup
- Documentation backup
- Archive creation and compression

### 3. BackupRestorer (`backup_restorer.py`)
**Backup restoration functionality** (204 lines)
- Archive extraction
- Database restoration
- Configuration restoration
- Code state restoration (with safety checks)
- Documentation restoration

### 4. BackupManager (`backup_manager.py`)
**Backup listing and cleanup operations** (158 lines)
- List available backups with metadata
- Cleanup old backups
- Backup validation
- Integrity checking

## Usage

The modular components are orchestrated through the main `backup_system.py` script (54 lines):

```bash
# Create backup
python scripts/backup_system.py backup --description "Before major update"

# List backups
python scripts/backup_system.py list

# Restore backup
python scripts/backup_system.py restore --backup-id backup_20250628_143022

# Cleanup old backups
python scripts/backup_system.py cleanup --keep 3
```

## Benefits of Modular Design

1. **Maintainability**: Each component under 210 lines with single responsibility
2. **Testability**: Components can be tested independently
3. **Reusability**: Utilities shared across components
4. **Clarity**: Clear separation of concerns
5. **AI-Friendly**: Optimal file sizes for AI agent comprehension

## Component Dependencies

```
backup_system.py (main orchestrator)
├── BackupCreator → BackupUtils
├── BackupRestorer → BackupUtils  
└── BackupManager → BackupUtils
```

All components depend on `BackupUtils` for shared functionality, avoiding code duplication while maintaining independence.

## Backward Compatibility

The main `backup_system.py` script maintains 100% backward compatibility with the original monolithic implementation. All existing usage patterns continue to work unchanged.
