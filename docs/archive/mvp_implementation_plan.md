## Key Implementation Details

### Tool Permission Model
```python
# Base tools by agent type
agent_base_permissions = {
    "agent_selector": ["entity_manager"],
    "planning_agent": ["entity_manager"],
    "context_addition": ["entity_manager", "file_system_listing"],
    "tool_addition": ["entity_manager", "file_system_listing"],
    "review_agent": ["entity_manager", "sql_lite", "file_system_listing"],
    "recovery_agent": ["entity_manager", "sql_lite", "terminal"],
    # ... more agents
}

# Dynamic assignment based on task
task_tool_assignments = {
    "analysis_task": ["sql_lite"],
    "file_editing_task": ["file_edit"],
    "debugging_task": ["terminal"],
    # Assigned at runtime by tool_addition agent
}
```

### Tool Request Flow
1. Agent identifies need for additional capability
2. Calls `need_more_tools` with justification
3. Request validation agent evaluates necessity
4. Tool addition agent assigns appropriate tools
5. Database updated with time-limited permissions
6. Agent proceeds with enhanced capabilities

### Security Layers
1. **Database Permissions**: Base tools and entity access
2. **MCP Server Validation**: Operation-level permission checks
3. **Path/Command Whitelisting**: Sandboxed execution environment
4. **Usage Tracking**: Complete audit trail for analysis
5. **Time Limits**: Automatic permission expiration
