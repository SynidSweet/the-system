### Specialized Context Documents
Each agent has dedicated context guides:
- `planning_agent_guide.md` - Task decomposition strategies
- `investigator_agent_guide.md` - Investigation techniques
- `optimizer_agent_guide.md` - Optimization methodologies
- `recovery_agent_guide.md` - Recovery procedures
- `feedback_agent_guide.md` - User interaction best practices

### Supporting Documents
- `performance_guide` - System performance monitoring
- `error_handling_guide` - Error classification and handling
- `user_interaction_guide` - Communication principles
- `recovery_procedures` - Detailed recovery playbooks
- `feedback_handling_procedures` - Feedback processing workflows

## Key Features

### Process-Aware Planning
The Planning Agent understands which tasks can be handled by processes vs requiring agent intelligence, leading to more efficient task execution.

### Data-Driven Investigation
The Investigator Agent uses SQL queries and event analysis to uncover patterns and root causes, providing evidence-based insights.

### Continuous Optimization
The Optimizer Agent implements A/B testing and incremental improvements, ensuring the system becomes more efficient over time.

### Resilient Recovery
The Recovery Agent provides multiple recovery strategies (retry, rollback, restart, failover) ensuring system stability.

### User-Centric Feedback
The Feedback Agent maintains professional communication and ensures user input drives system improvements.

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema
Created two migration files:
1. `004_add_phase6_agents.sql` - Adds agents, permissions, relationships
2. `005_add_phase6_context_documents.sql` - Adds context documents

### Agent Permissions
Each agent has specific base permissions:
- **Planning**: read, write, execute
- **Investigator**: read, analyze
- **Optimizer**: read, write, optimize
- **Recovery**: read, write, execute, rollback
- **Feedback**: read, write, communicate

### Tool Assignments
Agents have access to appropriate tools:
- **Planning**: break_down_task, start_subtask, entity_manager, sql_lite
- **Investigator**: sql_lite, entity_manager, file_system
- **Optimizer**: sql_lite, entity_manager, message_user
- **Recovery**: entity_manager, terminal, sql_lite, flag_for_review
- **Feedback**: message_user, entity_manager, start_subtask

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Enhanced Planning**: More sophisticated task decomposition with process awareness
2. **Better Insights**: Data-driven investigation and pattern analysis
3. **Improved Performance**: Systematic optimization with measurable results
4. **System Resilience**: Automatic error recovery and stability maintenance
5. **User Satisfaction**: Professional feedback handling and communication

## Testing and Validation

Created `test_phase6_agents.py` to validate:
- Agent relationship integrity
- Tool availability
- Permission configurations
- Integration patterns

All validations pass successfully.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Execute database migrations to deploy agents
2. Test agent interactions with sample tasks
3. Monitor agent performance and effectiveness

### Future Enhancements
1. Advanced planning algorithms
2. Machine learning for pattern detection
3. Predictive optimization
4. Proactive error prevention
5. Natural language feedback processing

## Integration with Previous Phases

Phase 6 builds upon:
- **Phase 1**: Uses entity tables for agent storage
- **Phase 2**: Leverages event system for monitoring
- **Phase 3**: Integrates with entity management
- **Phase 4**: Works with process framework
