# Entity Architecture Guide

## Core Concept

The agent system is built around six fundamental entity types that work together to create a self-improving, recursive problem-solving architecture. Every component of the system—from agents to tasks to documentation—is an entity that can be created, modified, analyzed, and optimized through systematic processes.

## The Six Entity Types

### 1. Agents - The Intelligent Actors
**Purpose**: Specialized LLM instances that execute tasks with domain-specific expertise

**Key Characteristics**:
- Each agent has a specific specialization and instruction set
- Agents inherit core capabilities but have unique context and tools
- Model assignment optimizes cost and capability for each agent type
- Agents work within entity framework to access and manipulate system state

**Entity Relationships**:
- **Uses** Documents for context and domain knowledge
- **Uses** Tools for capability execution
- **Creates** Tasks when spawning subtasks
- **Triggers** Processes for structured workflows
- **Generates** Events through all activities

**Lifecycle**:
1. **Creation**: Agent Creator designs specialization and capabilities
2. **Assignment**: Agent Selector matches agents to appropriate tasks
3. **Execution**: Agent works within entity framework to complete tasks
4. **Evolution**: Agent configuration optimized based on performance data
5. **Specialization**: Agent capabilities refined through usage patterns

### 2. Tasks - The Work Units
**Purpose**: Atomic units of progress that can be nested, composed, and coordinated

**Key Characteristics**:
- Tasks can have parent tasks, child tasks, and dependencies
- Each task is assigned to exactly one agent with additional context and tools
- Tasks exist within trees that provide isolation and coordination
- Task execution generates rich event data for learning and optimization

**Entity Relationships**:
- **Assigned to** exactly one Agent for execution
- **May have** parent Task and multiple child Tasks

- **Triggers** Processes for standard workflows
- **Generates** Events throughout lifecycle

**Lifecycle**:
1. **Creation**: Spawned by agents, processes, or users
2. **Planning**: Planning Agent may break down into subtasks

4. **Execution**: Assigned agent works to complete objective
5. **Evaluation**: Task Evaluator assesses completion quality
6. **Completion**: Results summarized and fed back to parent context

### 3. Processes - The Workflow Templates
**Purpose**: Reusable templates that codify successful approaches into structured workflows

**Key Characteristics**:
- Processes are JSON templates with parameterization and substitution
- Process steps can include agent prompts, tool calls, subtask spawning, and conditional logic
- Successful task patterns automatically converted into process templates
- Processes enable automation and reduce unpredictability

**Entity Relationships**:
- **Triggered by** Agents and Tasks for structured execution
- **Uses** other Processes for composition and nesting

2. **Creation**: New tools implemented or existing tools composed
3. **Integration**: Tools added to registry with proper metadata
4. **Usage**: Agents utilize tools for task execution
5. **Optimization**: Tool effectiveness measured and improved

### 5. Documents - The Knowledge Base
**Purpose**: Structured knowledge that provides context, guidance, and accumulated wisdom

**Key Characteristics**:
- Documents are markdown files stored in database with rich metadata
- Documents categorized by type (system, process, reference, guide, etc.)
- Document effectiveness measured based on usage outcomes
- Knowledge base grows and evolves through system learning

**Entity Relationships**:
- **Used by** Agents as context for task execution
- **Referenced by** Processes for guidance and procedures

**Lifecycle**:
1. **Creation**: Documentation Agent creates based on knowledge needs
2. **Usage**: Agents access documents for context and guidance
3. **Effectiveness Tracking**: Document utility measured through usage outcomes
4. **Evolution**: Documents updated and refined based on effectiveness data
5. **Organization**: Knowledge base structure optimized for discoverability

### 6. Events - The Learning Infrastructure
**Purpose**: Comprehensive logging of all system activity for analysis and optimization

**Key Characteristics**:
- Events capture every entity interaction and system operation
- Event chains enable tracing of causality and dependency
- Event analysis drives optimization and improvement
- Events enable rolling review counters and systematic evaluation

**Entity Relationships**:
- **Created by** all other entity types through their activities
- **References** all entities involved in the logged activity
- **Chains with** other Events to show causality and workflow
- **Triggers** optimization reviews when patterns indicate opportunities

**Lifecycle**:
1. **Generation**: Created automatically by all entity operations
2. **Aggregation**: Event chains assembled for workflow analysis
3. **Analysis**: Optimizer Agent identifies patterns and opportunities
4. **Triggering**: Rolling counters trigger reviews when thresholds reached
5. **Learning**: Insights from event analysis improve system performance

## Entity Interaction Patterns

### Composition Patterns
**Agent + Task + Process**: Agent executes task using process template for structured workflow
**Process + Tools + Documents**: Process coordinates tools using document guidance
**Task + Dependencies + Events**: Task coordination through dependency management and event tracking

### Learning Patterns
**Event → Analysis → Optimization**: Events analyzed to identify optimization opportunities
**Pattern → Process**: Successful patterns codified into reusable process templates
**Usage → Effectiveness → Evolution**: Entity usage drives effectiveness measurement and evolution

### Coordination Patterns
**Tree Isolation**: Task trees provide coordination boundaries
**Dependency Management**: Tasks coordinate through explicit dependency relationships
**Event Broadcasting**: Important events broadcast to interested entities

## Entity Relationships

### Relationship Types
- **Uses**: Entity utilizes another entity for functionality
- **Creates**: Entity generates new instances of another entity type
- **Depends On**: Entity requires another entity for successful operation
- **Triggers**: Entity initiates another entity or process
- **References**: Entity includes another entity in its configuration or content
- **Contains**: Entity includes another entity as a component
- **Optimizes**: Entity improves another entity's performance or configuration

### Relationship Strength
Relationships have numerical strength values (0.0 to 1.0) indicating:
- **0.9-1.0**: Critical dependency, entity cannot function without this relationship
- **0.7-0.8**: Important relationship, significant impact on effectiveness
- **0.5-0.6**: Moderate relationship, useful but not essential
- **0.1-0.4**: Weak relationship, minimal impact on functionality

### Relationship Evolution
- Relationships strengthen through successful usage patterns
- Weak relationships may be pruned for system optimization
- New relationships discovered through event analysis
- Relationship patterns inform entity design and optimization

## Entity Lifecycle Management

### Creation Patterns
**User-Initiated**: Users create tasks that spawn entity creation chains
**Agent-Initiated**: Agents create entities as needed for task execution
