## Next Steps

1. **Review Documentation** - Thoroughly review all created documentation for completeness
2. **Implementation Planning** - Create detailed technical implementation plan
3. **Development Environment** - Set up development environment for entity framework
4. **Team Coordination** - If working with a team, assign implementation responsibilities  
5. **Begin Implementation** - Start with Phase 1 (Core Entity Framework)

The entity-based architecture transforms your MVP from a proof-of-concept into a genuinely self-improving system with systematic learning capabilities. The comprehensive documentation provides the foundation for implementation, while the phased approach ensures manageable development with early validation opportunities.

Focus on getting the core entity framework working first, then gradually add the process engine and agent integrations. Each phase builds on the previous one, creating a robust foundation for long-term system evolution and capability development.
