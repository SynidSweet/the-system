6. **Error Prevention**: Add validation and safety checks

### Improvement Lifecycle

1. **Discovery**: Through monitoring or agent request
2. **Validation**: Feasibility and safety checks
3. **Testing**: 24-hour controlled deployment
4. **Monitoring**: Effectiveness tracking
5. **Decision**: Keep or rollback based on metrics
6. **Documentation**: Record outcomes

### System Integration

- **Event System**: Tracks all improvement activities
- **Entity Framework**: Manages entity modifications
- **Process Framework**: Executes improvement workflows
- **Database**: Stores history and opportunities
- **API**: Provides dashboard and control

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Continuous Evolution**: System improves without manual intervention
2. **Data-Driven Decisions**: Improvements based on actual metrics
3. **Safe Experimentation**: Changes tested before full deployment
4. **Agent Empowerment**: Agents contribute to system evolution
5. **Transparency**: Full visibility into improvement activities

## Database Schema

### New Tables
- `improvement_history`: Tracks all improvement attempts
- `improvement_alerts`: Monitors system health

### New Views
- `improvement_analytics`: Aggregated improvement metrics
- `self_improvement_status`: Entity improvement status
- `self_improvement_metrics`: System-wide metrics
- `system_self_improvement_status`: Overall health

### Migrations
- `006_add_improvement_history.sql`: Core improvement tracking
- `007_add_self_improvement_context.sql`: Tools and context

## Configuration

### Engine Settings
```python
min_confidence_score = 0.8
test_duration_hours = 24
improvement_batch_size = 5
rollback_threshold = -0.1  # 10% degradation
max_concurrent_improvements = 3
cooldown_period = timedelta(hours=6)
```

### Entity Configuration
```json
{
  "auto_improve_enabled": true,
  "min_confidence_threshold": 0.8,
  "test_duration_hours": 24,
  "max_rollback_rate": 0.1
}
```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Alert Types
- `high_rollback_rate`: >30% improvements rolled back
- `degraded_performance`: >20% performance drop
- `opportunity_backlog`: >50 pending opportunities
- `recurring_failure`: Same error 5+ times/hour

### Health Status
- **Excellent**: High effectiveness, low rollbacks
- **Good**: Positive improvements, stable
- **Fair**: Mixed results, needs attention
- **Needs Attention**: Active alerts, degradation

## Usage Examples

### Agent Requesting Improvement
```python
await request_improvement(
    improvement_type="context_optimization",
    description="Add performance guide to context",
    rationale="Frequently need performance metrics reference",
    evidence={"failed_tasks": ["task_123"], "time_wasted": "15min"}
)
```

### Manual Improvement Trigger
```bash
POST /api/improvements/trigger-improvement/agent/1
{
  "improvement_type": "performance_tuning",
  "description": "Optimize database queries for task retrieval"
}
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Predictive Optimization**: Anticipate issues before they occur
2. **Cross-Entity Learning**: Apply successful patterns broadly
3. **Machine Learning Integration**: Advanced pattern recognition
4. **Autonomous Capability Expansion**: Self-directed growth
