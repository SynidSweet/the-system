# Rebuild Analysis: Major Differences Between Current System and New Entity-Based Architecture

## Executive Summary

The rebuild specifications represent a fundamental shift from an agent-centric architecture to an entity-based framework. This transformation introduces six core entity types (Agents, Tasks, Processes, Tools, Documents, Events) that work together to create a more systematic, observable, and self-improving system. The new architecture emphasizes structured workflows, comprehensive event logging, and data-driven optimization over the current system's more reactive, ad-hoc approach.

## Core Architectural Changes

### 1. From Agent-Centric to Entity-Based Architecture

**Current System:**
- Everything revolves around agents as the primary actors
- Agents handle both orchestration and execution
- Limited structured interaction patterns
- Direct agent-to-agent communication

**New System:**
- Six fundamental entity types with clear relationships
- Entities interact through defined patterns and relationships
- Structured coordination through the entity framework
- Entity relationships tracked with strength values (0.0 to 1.0)

### 2. Introduction of Process Entity Type

**Current System:**
- No concept of reusable process templates
- All workflows are agent-driven and ad-hoc
- Limited automation of repetitive patterns
- Success patterns not systematically captured

**New System:**
- Process entities capture successful patterns as reusable templates
- JSON-based process templates with:
  - Step types (agent_prompt, tool_call, subtask_spawn, condition_check, loop, parallel_execution)
  - Parameter substitution with `{{variable}}` syntax
  - Conditional logic and error handling
  - Success criteria and metadata tracking
- Automatic conversion of successful patterns to process templates
- Process execution engine for structured workflow automation

### 3. Comprehensive Event System

**Current System:**
- Basic message logging in the messages table
- Limited tracking of system operations
- No systematic pattern analysis
- Reactive problem detection

**New System:**
- Events as first-class entities tracking ALL system operations
- Structured event schema with:
  - Event types for all entity lifecycle operations
  - Related entity tracking
  - Event chains for causality analysis
  - Resource usage metrics
  - Outcome tracking (success, failure, partial, error, timeout)
- Event-driven optimization and pattern recognition
- Rolling review counters triggering systematic improvements

### 4. Enhanced Database Schema

**Current System:**
```sql
- agents (basic configuration)
- tasks (simple parent-child relationships)
- messages (basic logging)
- context_documents
- tools
- system_events (minimal)
```

**New System:**
```sql
- Entities table (base for all entity types)
- Entity_relationships (tracked relationships with strength values)
- Events (comprehensive activity logging)
- Processes (workflow templates)
- Review_counters (rolling optimization triggers)
- Enhanced indexes for performance
- Views for entity usage statistics and effectiveness
```

### 5. Agent Evolution

**Current System:**
- 8 specialized agents with fixed roles
- Agents work independently with minimal coordination
- Limited learning from experience
- Static agent configurations

**New System:**
- Agents exist within entity framework
- New agent types introduced:
  - **Planning Agent** (replaces task_breakdown with process integration)
  - **Investigator Agent** (handles novel problems and research)
  - **Optimizer Agent** (systematic improvement through event analysis)
  - **Recovery Agent** (error handling and system resilience)
  - **Feedback Agent** (user interaction and satisfaction)
- Dynamic agent creation based on capability gaps
- Agent performance tracked through events
- Systematic agent optimization through rolling reviews

### 6. Task Management Changes

**Current System:**
- Simple parent-child task relationships
- Limited coordination mechanisms
- Basic status tracking
- No dependency management

**New System:**
- Tasks as entities with rich relationships
- Explicit dependency management
- Task templates through process integration
- Priority levels (LOW, NORMAL, HIGH, URGENT)
- Enhanced status tracking with more granular states
- Task execution coordinated through process templates

### 7. Self-Improvement Mechanisms

**Current System:**
- Ad-hoc self-modification through file editing
- Limited systematic improvement
- No structured optimization cycles
- Manual identification of improvement opportunities

**New System:**
- Entity-based optimization through rolling review counters
- Event-driven pattern recognition
- Systematic improvement processes:
  - Usage-based review triggers
  - Multi-dimensional optimization
  - Automated pattern-to-process conversion
  - Predictive improvement capabilities
- Structured validation and rollback mechanisms

### 8. Document and Knowledge Management

**Current System:**
- Static context documents
- Limited effectiveness tracking
- Manual document updates
- No systematic knowledge capture

**New System:**
- Documents as entities with effectiveness scores
- Usage-based effectiveness measurement
- Automatic documentation generation from patterns
- Knowledge accumulation through event analysis
- Document relationships tracked in entity graph

### 9. Tool Management Evolution

**Current System:**
- Static tool registry
- Limited tool composition
- Manual tool creation
- No usage optimization

**New System:**
- Tools as entities with performance metrics
- Tool composition and orchestration capabilities
- Process-based tool creation
- Usage pattern analysis for optimization
- Dynamic tool discovery and creation

### 10. Quality Assurance Integration

**Current System:**
- Separate evaluation step after task completion
- Limited quality metrics
- No systematic quality improvement
- Manual quality assessment

**New System:**
- Quality checkpoints integrated into processes
- Multi-dimensional quality assessment
- Automated quality gates
- Quality metrics tracked through events
- Continuous quality improvement through optimization
