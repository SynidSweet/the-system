# Entity-Based Architecture Overview

## System Components Integration

This document provides an overview of how all the specifications fit together to create the complete entity-based, self-improving agent system.

## Core Architecture Layers

### 1. Entity Layer (Foundation)
**Specification**: `entity_architecture_guide.md`, `updated_schemas.md`

The foundation of the system - everything is an entity:
- **Agents**: Specialized workers with instructions and capabilities
- **Tasks**: Units of work with state and dependencies
- **Processes**: Python scripts that orchestrate deterministic logic
- **Tools**: Capabilities that agents can invoke
- **Documents**: Context and knowledge storage
- **Events**: Comprehensive activity tracking

### 2. Event System (Nervous System)
**Specification**: `event_system_guide.md`

The comprehensive tracking and learning infrastructure:
- Captures every significant operation
- Enables pattern recognition and optimization
- Triggers reviews through rolling counters
- Provides performance metrics and insights

### 3. Runtime Engine (Heart)
**Specification**: `runtime_specification.md`

The event-driven execution engine:
- **Task State Machine**: 8 states with automatic transitions
- **Dependency Resolution**: Tasks progress when dependencies complete
- **Event-Driven**: No polling, pure reactive architecture
- **Concurrency Control**: Manages parallel agent execution

### 4. Process Framework (Brain Stem)
**Specification**: `process_architecture_spec.md`, `process_framework_guide.md`

Hybrid Python + LLM architecture:
- **Python Logic**: Handles deterministic operations
- **Strategic LLM Calls**: Only when reasoning/creativity needed
- **Neutral Task Process**: Default process for all tasks
- **Tool Processes**: Triggered by agent tool calls

### 5. Agent Ecosystem (Workforce)
**Specifications**: Various agent guides

Specialized agents working together:
- **Agent Selector**: Routes tasks to optimal agents
- **Planning Agent**: Breaks down complex problems
- **Context Addition**: Manages knowledge needs
- **Tool Addition**: Expands capabilities
- **Task Evaluator**: Ensures quality
- **Documentation Agent**: Captures knowledge
- **Summary Agent**: Synthesizes information
- **Review Agent**: Implements improvements
- **Investigator Agent**: Analyzes patterns
- **Optimizer Agent**: Improves performance
- **Recovery Agent**: Handles failures
- **Feedback Agent**: User interaction

## System Operation Flow

### 1. Task Creation
1. User submits request
2. Task entity created with state `CREATED`
3. Runtime assigns default `NeutralTaskProcess`

### 2. Process Execution
1. NeutralTaskProcess executes:
   - Creates subtask for agent selection
   - Creates subtask for context analysis
   - Creates subtask for tool determination
2. Task transitions to `READY_FOR_AGENT`

### 3. Agent Execution
1. Runtime triggers agent LLM call
2. Agent reasons and may call tools
3. Tool calls trigger processes (e.g., `break_down_task`)
4. Processes create subtasks as dependencies

### 4. Dependency Resolution
1. Task enters `WAITING_ON_DEPENDENCIES`
2. Subtasks execute (recursively following same flow)
3. Completion events cascade up
4. Parent task resumes when dependencies complete

### 5. Continuous Improvement
1. Events logged throughout execution
2. Pattern analyzer detects opportunities
3. Review counters trigger optimization tasks
4. System implements improvements autonomously

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Everything is Data-Driven
- Behavior comes from database configuration
- No hardcoded logic in core runtime
- Entities define capabilities and relationships

### 2. Deterministic vs Creative Separation
- Processes handle deterministic logic in Python
- LLM calls only for reasoning and creativity
- Clear boundaries reduce token usage

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture
- No polling or busy waiting
- State changes trigger progression
- Dependency resolution is automatic

### 4. Self-Improvement Through Use
- Every operation generates learnable events
- Patterns become processes
- Failures trigger recovery and improvement

### 5. Composability
- Small, focused agents and tools
- Processes compose complex workflows
- Entities relate through typed relationships

## Migration Strategy

The system is being built in phases to ensure stability:

1. **Phase 1-2**: Foundation (Database + Events) âœ… COMPLETE
2. **Phase 3**: Entity Management Layer (Week 3)
3. **Phase 4**: Process Framework & Runtime (Week 4)
4. **Phase 5-6**: New Agents (Weeks 5-6)
5. **Phase 7-8**: Optimization & Cleanup (Weeks 7-8)

Each phase maintains backward compatibility while adding new capabilities.

## Future Vision

The completed system will:
- **Self-organize**: Optimal agent and tool selection
- **Self-optimize**: Continuous performance improvement
- **Self-document**: Automatic knowledge capture
- **Self-heal**: Error recovery and adaptation
- **Scale efficiently**: Through process automation
- **Learn continuously**: From every interaction

The entity-based architecture provides the flexibility and structure needed for unlimited growth while maintaining system coherence and quality.
