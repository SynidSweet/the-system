# Runtime Migration Complete

## Overview

The system has been successfully migrated from the old agent-based architecture to the new entity-based runtime engine. This migration eliminates the legacy task manager and message-based execution in favor of a process-driven, event-based architecture.

## Key Changes

### 1. Task Creation
- **OLD**: Tasks created through `task_manager.submit_task()`
- **NEW**: Tasks created through `runtime_integration.create_task()`
- All tasks now go through the runtime engine with proper state management

### 2. Agent Execution
- **OLD**: `UniversalAgent` with message-based execution
- **NEW**: `UniversalAgentRuntime` that integrates with the runtime engine
- Tool calls now trigger processes instead of direct execution

### 3. Tool Call Processing
- **OLD**: Direct tool execution within agents
- **NEW**: Tool calls mapped to processes via `RuntimeIntegration.handle_tool_call()`
- Core tools (break_down_task, start_subtask, etc.) trigger Python processes

### 4. State Management
- **OLD**: Simple task status (QUEUED, RUNNING, COMPLETE, FAILED)
- **NEW**: Comprehensive state machine with 9 states:
  - CREATED
  - PROCESS_ASSIGNED
  - READY_FOR_AGENT
  - WAITING_ON_DEPENDENCIES
  - AGENT_RESPONDING
  - TOOL_PROCESSING
  - COMPLETED
  - FAILED
  - MANUAL_HOLD

### 5. API Endpoints
All API endpoints have been updated to work directly with the runtime engine:
- `/tasks` - Creates tasks via runtime
- `/tasks/active` - Queries database directly
- `/tasks/{task_id}` - Gets status from database and runtime
- `/system/config` - Updates runtime settings
- `/system/step` - Controls manual stepping via runtime

### 6. Process Framework
The following processes are now active:
- `NeutralTaskProcess` - Default process for all tasks
- `BreakDownTaskProcess` - Handles task decomposition
- `CreateSubtaskProcess` - Creates individual subtasks
- `EndTaskProcess` - Handles task completion
- `NeedMoreContextProcess` - Manages context requests

### 7. Removed Components
- `task_manager.py` - No longer needed
- `DualOperationManager` - Runtime-only mode
- Legacy agent wrappers
- Message-based task queue

## Benefits

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: All operations tracked through events
2. **Deterministic Processes**: Python logic separated from LLM reasoning
3. **Better State Management**: Clear state transitions with validation
4. **Dependency Tracking**: Automatic task dependency resolution
5. **Process Orchestration**: Tool calls trigger complex workflows
6. **Improved Monitoring**: Comprehensive runtime statistics

## Configuration

The system now runs in "runtime_first" mode, meaning:
- All tasks use the new runtime engine
- No fallback to legacy systems
- Full process-based execution

## Next Steps

1. Monitor system performance with new runtime
2. Add more specialized processes as needed
3. Enhance process orchestration capabilities
4. Implement advanced dependency strategies

## Migration Status

âœ… **COMPLETE** - The system is now fully migrated to the new runtime engine.
