# System Update Plan: Agent to Entity Architecture Migration

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for migrating the current agent-based system to the new entity-based architecture. The migration will be performed in phases to ensure system stability while progressively implementing new capabilities.

## Executive Summary

The system update involves a fundamental architectural shift from an agent-centric to an entity-based framework. This migration introduces:
- A structured entity system with 6 core types (Agents, Tasks, Tools, Context, Relationships, Processes)
- Comprehensive event tracking for all system operations
- **Python-based process system** with strategic LLM calls (hybrid architecture)
- **Event-driven runtime engine** with automatic task progression
- Enhanced agent capabilities with 5 new specialized agents
- Systematic self-improvement through data-driven optimization
- Advanced monitoring and quality assurance mechanisms

### Updated Architecture Highlights (as of 2025-06-19)

Based on refined specifications:
- **Processes are Python scripts** that handle deterministic logic and orchestrate LLM calls
- **Runtime is purely event-driven** with a task state machine (no polling)
- **Neutral Task Process** serves as the default for tasks without specific processes
- **Tool calls trigger processes** rather than direct execution
